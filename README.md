## Problem Statement
• We have all been in situation where we go to a doctor in emergency and find that the consultation fees are too high. As a data scientist we all should do better. What if you have data that records important details about a doctor and you get to build a model to predict the doctor’s consulting fee?

• In this repository you will find __Code__, __Algorithms used__ and __Accuracy__ of the model.
